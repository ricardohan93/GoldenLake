## Golden Lake Golf Club Website

This is the first version of a Golden Lake website redesign. Made to be responsive, display a modern design and better performance, this website aim to be supported in every device.
I am constantly thinking of new ways to improve every aspect of this page, therefore it is continuously going through changes and improvements. It is a safe place where I 'learn by doing', experiment and implement new thoughts.
